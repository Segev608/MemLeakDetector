Welcome to the tests tutorial!
As the main README (README.md) said, we will compile our tests in "Debug" mode,
i.e. use '/Zi /MD /Od' for flags in the compiler, unless specified differently!
We also compile for x32 with 'vcvars32.bat' before calling 'cl', again, unless specified differently.

The tests in this folder are ordered and we recommend following the order.
Each of the tests shows different feature/capability of the Memcheck tool.
Each of them also contains a short README that takes into account you read the previous ones.
Enjoy!
