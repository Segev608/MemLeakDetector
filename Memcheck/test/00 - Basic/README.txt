Welcome to the tests tutorial!
As the main README (README.md) said, we will compile our tests in "Debug" mode,
i.e. use '/Zi /MD /Od' for flags in the compiler, unless specified differently!
We also compile for x32 with 'vcvars32.bat' before calling 'cl', again,unless specified differently.

In this test you can see the program has some leaks and in the summary section you can see the overall results of your program.
